### Me

Hi I'm Andrew Longstaff, I'm a Digital Craftsman, focusing on user-centric design and development for todays modern digital lifestyle.
My focus is mainly on [web development](/tag/#webdev), but I am keen on keeping my fingers in other tech and have been known to play with [native android and ios](/tag/#phonedev), [hardware](/tag/#hardwaredev) such as Arduino and Proton boards as well as [3D programs](/tag/#dddev) such as Unity. My latest on a long list of loves is [VR and augmented reality](/tag/#vrdev), and exploring the new opportunities for interation spaces that this could bring up, both with modern tech and in the future developments.
Im also an [artist](/tag/#art), [photographer](/tag/#photo), [maker](/tag/#make), and [gamer](/tag/#game) and have a reputation of [overanalysing](/tag/#theory) and thinking about things far too much, so i'll see what I can to to spill that onto these pages too.

### Work Life

I currently work at [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/)'s London office as a Javascript Engineer and can be seen buried in code, leading development teams, being involved in design meetings and rapid prototyping for user tests. I am also a keen hacker so will be seen occasionally outside the office in hackathons.
