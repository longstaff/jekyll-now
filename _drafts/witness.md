# The Witness 

The witness has a false premise, one that runs through the entire game, and one that it seems to accept and acknowledge internally.

## The game
For those of you who haven't played the witness I would highly recommend it for those people who like small puzzles and intriguing mechanics, and the story is interesting and thought provoking of you can be bothered to pick up some crumbs. In case you are one of those people, spoilers ahead so stop reading now and go pay it, this will still be here when you are done.

**Spoilers**. We clear? Good. The game revolves around a virtual island designed for relaxation and unwinding, we can see this in its general setting of beauty, the lack of any danger anywhere and the specific lounge chairs, drinks, etc. Scattered around the beaches and vistas. Even more obvious is when you break through the gate and visit what can mainly be described as a hotel lounge, pools bars, restaurants and hallways are scattered with company logos, chairs to relax in (if you could sit in the game) and great views over the island.

## puzzles

The island itself is one big puzzle box, scattered through [300] puzzles across the island, all line puzzles and all operating on strict rules that you pick up in 6 different sections. The specific type of puzzles are fairly arbitrary for our argument so no solutions here, just be known that there are a few styles.

1. Story puzzles are specifically linked in groups of 10 or so, by completing one you unlock a slightly harder one, and so on until you reach the end and unlock a laser. Once multiple lasers are unlocked you can complete the final puzzles. Unlocking the puzzles requires mastery of the puzzles that are presented as the difficulty curve grows.

2. Hidden puzzles are literally scattered around the landscape and rely on perspective tricks to create line puzzles in every object around you, these are not difficult to complete, but they are difficult to spot, some taking extreme patience to complete as it may include moving objects. These are marked and noted on big black monoliths, giving a hint to direction and shape, and when all shapes are completed they become white.

3. Video puzzles are very hard puzzles that are stand alone but when opened unlock a code that unlocks a video in a projector room later on. These give an interesting background into the thoughts of the creators, but are not mandatory for the game completion.

4. Random puzzles
There are a number of puzzles in the game that don't seem to do anything, you complete a section and literally nothing happens, move on.

5. Challenge puzzles
There is one last section of the game that powers on a set of puzzles when you start a record and you have the length of the record to complete them, the puzzles are hard and even have unsolvable bluff puzzles to avoid, to get through these you have to practice, try and try again before finally getting your prize, the last video code.

6. Utility puzzles are also here, mainly to keep theme as far as I can tell, each locked door, hatch etc requires a simple puzzle to complete before it opens, this is as sometimes literally just one line as a mechanism.

## audio

As well as the puzzles we get a collection of audio snippets, read or loud by a few people but mostly quotes, wide ranging science and philosophy figures all giving a global thought of the smallness of humanity, the greatness of the endeavour of science and contemplation on morality. There are a few notable exceptions to this, mainly at the end 'secret' bits where there are notes from the game creators themselves in a fly-on-the-wall I-left-my-recorder-on kind of way and then in more utilitarian usage to give the game credits. These we will explore later.

## endings

There are two endings that I can see, one that is fairly obvious, you complete the run of puzzles all the way, you solve the huge labyrinthine office complex of broken strange imagery and at the end there is a silver lift. You get into the lift, solve the last puzzles to start it and fly over the island, watching it reset itself again, weaving around the island and putting you back to the start accompanied by quotes that are somewhat Buddhist in origin, about the temporal nature of the world and how nothing lasts.
You get back to the start and are unceremoniously dumped out the game, presumably you are then supposed to start again.

The second version requires you to either 

a. Solve all the very hard puzzles, unlock a secret area, come all the way back to the start of the game and re-lock the first door you unlock in the game so you can complete a hidden puzzle. 

b. Remember (or write down) how the first puzzle was in the first place, allowing you to lock it again later or

c. Just restart the game again as in ending 1, the gate is already locked and it's very obvious on your second time around so you are almost guaranteed to find it.

The ending itself is the end to the experience, it walks you through a hotel like series of lounges, walkways and tells you the credits. You see some hints of the last bits of the island that you won't have seen unless you find all the secrets as a teaser to keep looking and then if you keep going on you see a photo of an office with a person under a sheet on a couch, you walk on and then you spiral into nothing in a very Alice in wonderland kind of way. This unceremonious exit leads you out of the game and to a video clip of "you" with POV camera walking up, unplugging yourself from the game, exploring your surroundings like you arnt used to normal life any more and constantly tapping on things that look circular. This last video is a great look into the psychology of the real game and not the front, so we will examine these in detail.

## dichotomy: the 'real', the 'really real' and the 'simulated real'

There are three levels that apply to the game which confuses slightly, but it is key to seeing the game as a whole and specifically flawed experiment.

The *real* is the layer that the game is attempting to display as life, that there are game designers who made this, that you are a tester? A early stage user? Anyway, possibly a developer yourself or somehow involved as you wake up in the development office. This layer is the story element and shows the flaws in the game.

The *really real* is literally the real you and I know which is presumably pretended not to exist in the game. You are a person sitting at a computer with a keyboard and mouse (probably) playing a game. This layer is slightly breaking of the narrative but needs acknowledgement in the play.

The *simulated* is the game world, the island and the spaces that are presented to you in the game to explore.

## themes

Buddhism
Temporality
Anti-corporation/office
Perception


## problems

The effect can be found in the notes left behind for you to find too, talking of Zen meditations, the concept of repetitions of the puzzles and repeating the island several times to unwind. [Find audio quotes here].
