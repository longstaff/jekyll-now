# In infinity

Exhibition of Yayoi Kusama in [HAM](https://www.hamhelsinki.fi/en/).

Yayoi kusama is a prolific artist, and has managed to successfully step from art to design aesthetics whist keeping her point of view fairly unchanged. Of course this is helped by her point of view being very repetitious patterning that is almost close to print making to begin with, but nevertheless it is a broad sphere to work with.

The show was interestingly curated with both entrance and exit covered in a typical dotted pattern and containing sculptural balloon like objects, creating an instant context and recognisably pop aesthetic.

## History
The exhibition spanned from Yayoi's early studies and work in more traditional syles of Japanese painting and natural subjects and moved on to finding her interest in the micro climates of cells and bacteria, abstracting shapes and forms and creating more expressive brushwork and stylings.

## Paintings
One full wall is dedicated to her daily painting efforts, patterned and symbolic, often dark and very harsh brushwork gives a visceral inquiry into Yayoi's mindscape, being inspired by dreams, hallucinations and memories to form on the large square canvas in a constant production line of recurring themes and vivid colour.

## Sculpture
Yayoi's exploration into decorating found objects with 'falluses', small stitched and stuffed pouches, and then painting it all white was represented by a collection ranging from mannequins to boats, in typical style all work was done by yayoi herself, rather than the aesthetic of the mass produced workshop extolled by Warhol and others that was coming into mainstream at the time.

Alongside these are some impressive pumpkins in metallic colourings with etched dots across the entire surface, these are large sized and beautifully finished, but somehow friendly rather than intimidating, the slumped soft shapes being wonderfully welcoming.

## Installations
The major part of Yayoi's work comes as installation work, mirrored rooms and strange spaces where you can walk through our poke your head into a strange world of Yayoi's making, unfortunately this is a somewhat individual exercise and there were some very long queues along the length of the gallery for them so they are probably best viewed at off-peak times. We never quite got to all of them, but the ones we did were nicely atmospheric and abstract spaces, floating colour changing lamps with pathways between, again rather ruined by people though. Definitely working on coming back when it is less busy to experience these better.

## Patterned paintings
There is a full overview of stages of the most known working style of Yayoi, greatly worked, detailed but repetitive paintings, starting with the earliest examples of the 'nets', sprawling paintings of white on white, heavy paint textures detailing an even net like pattern, yayoi herself described these as just a portion, that the nets expanded beyond the canvas infinitely in all directions, these were just what she was able to capture.
The dots series was similar, but bringing an even dot pattern onto patterned canvas, varying from completely even arrangements as in 'red dots' or in undulating waves across the canvas. The paintings are large in scale and are made of many separate pieces, sometimes made obvious by the changing pattern and sometimes continuous throughout, the red dots stands an impressive wall of texture filling your view, somehow calming and playful, especially liking the play on the title which should more accurately be 'black dots on red'.

## Design collaborations
These large dotted textures have been brought to usage in the more everyday spaces, working
