I really enjoyed playing with the code reserved words lists to try and make something lyrical, this is the result of the Promise syntax:

```javascript
function poem (promises) {
	if (i.make === you) {
		a = new Promise ((t,hat) => {
			t(ogether, love, shall).bind(us)
		}).then((will) => {
			you();
		}).catch((me) => {
			as = we.fall();
		});
		return {my: Promise.reject(the.darkness)};
	}
}
```
This is from a workshop on AI and the multiple ways that we now interact with it instead of people:

```javascript
function fAIl() {
	i.contacted (the.doctors, the.other, day);
	had = a.horrible (feeling); 
	that.would = !(go.away())
	for (inhumanLiving in a.world) {
		with (no) {
			soul();
		}
	}
	i.got({no: connection});
	i.could(!feel, whole);

	i.needTo(escape(this.feeling), ofDread); 
	need = a.solution(4, this) 
	switch(inMyHead(isIt, a)) {
		case ofTheMondays:
			a();
		case ofTheBlues:
			do_i ? justNeed() : a();
			break;
	}
	please();
	return some(good, news);

	i(waited && waited);
	it.finally = said;
	i.dont(understand, the.question);
	doYou = want(to.talk(2), a(human), instead);
}
```
