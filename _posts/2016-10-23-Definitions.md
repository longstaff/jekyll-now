All good projects have a set of goals and bases to build on, so here is my list of goals that I can look back on and define how successful I was. If I was hugely successful then check the git log and check that I havnt changed the goals...
<!-- more -->

These are fairly basic and might be added to over time.

## Goal 1: Become more comefortable with writing again.
I was a huge fan of writing essays in uni, the discursive style and the research was an enjoyable activity, but through the lack of time and effort I have kept an interest in research in various topics, but they never get to anything very specifc as an outcome. I would like to amend this, making small essays in fairly wide ranging subjects from psychology, design, code and art amongst others so that I can even research my own research again.
Hopefully this will be apparent in the posts that get written, but these will be not so close together, and rather will be lead by my interests at the time and my current reading materials etc.

## Goal 2: Be more organised about development.
There are several aspects that I want to develop myself, and these threads are multiple and diverse. Mostly keeping to a jotting book that I have handy but small tasks of research etc. get slightly lost and are badly collected, so to better document interesting ideas, avenues to explore and insights that I might have gethered that might be of interest later down the line.

## Goal 3: Become a better teacher.
My work involves teaching others techniques and tools, and I would love to be better at it than I am at the moment, mainly this is down to vocabulary and making sure that I have everything contained in my mind well enough that I can explain things clearly and simply. Putting things down here on wide topics, starter guides or opinionated rants will all help me crystalise my own ways of working and why I do them, which I hope will help others who read them at the same time.

## Goal 4: Inspire someone else
I really hope that something that I would write about or have interests in would be able to spark some interest in others, either in the tips that I give, the comments that I write or any comments that are generated, but good old fashioned debate is not yet dead, and I encourage well intentioned dialogue in most things that I do.
