Playing with package managers (in node) and what interesting things you can make by only using the available packages in npm.

To start I'm only using the top 100 or so packages, we can see where things go from there. using hyphens as breaks (commas, full stops etc) to try and make readable structures this has allowed for some good fun and varied results.

Critical error recovery:
```shell-session
npm i request express promise which once marked should resolve warning method-override open source-map progress through2 less boom
```

Don't tell the kids:
```shell-session
yarn add warning when bluebird meow merge through gulp compression moment assert prompt resolve once recompose prettier clone request
```

Custom order
```shell-session
yarn add prettier morgan clone styled-components inherits vinyl tape material-ui colours should express coffee gulp-sass promise boom through open connect moment method-override history object-assign angular body-parser progress rsvp
```

Love letters
```shell-session
npm i recompose optimist request when gulp coffee-script prompt prettier stylus font-awesome progress once history del datafire which asset warning when deep-equal bluebird moment resolve request-promise marked path extend through2 -save
```

Karma
```shell-session
yarn add karma when resolve bindings which promise less jest
```
